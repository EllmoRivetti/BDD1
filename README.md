School Project - Pizza Client Interface

To properly install this project, you'll have to use the next tools:  
- Eclipse (2018 or higher) or your favourite IDE  
- Maven to compile the project and manage the librairies  
- WAMP or any software used to host a database  
  
When you have everything, you should upload the database (common/rapizz.sql) into WAMP and change the parameters into the file (src/main/java/App/Model/DatabaseConnection.java).
Then you can compile the app using the maven run configuration "clean install" and use the generated .jar to test the app.  
  
I recommend using "java -jar name.jar" in a terminal to launch the app and see if any errors appears.
